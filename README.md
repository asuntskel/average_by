# Average-by utility for Crystal Enumerable(T)
Adds some basic `enumerable.average_by {|e| something }`, heavily inspired on the crystal source code
for other similar functions such as `max_by`.

To use, simply add the `average_by.cr` to your project source files and require it when needed.
To be used as a monkey_patch.
