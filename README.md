# `Enumerable#average_by` utility for Crystal
Module/monkey_patch to add some basic `enumerable.average_by {|e| something }`, heavily inspired on the crystal source code
for other similar functions such as `max_by`.

To use, simply add the `average_by.cr` to your project source files and require it when needed.
